## Content

In this folder you find the files used to setup a Mininet Topology and to run iTop on such topology.

Modifications to the topology ( as making some router non responding) are expected to be placed in the folder
containing the script to test.

### TODO

util.py contains functions for the 3 components. Think if it convenient to eliminate it, 
and put the functions inside the proper modules (Topology, Blockchain and Sensor).
